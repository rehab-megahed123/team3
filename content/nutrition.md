1. Eat a Balanced Diet
Include a variety of food groups: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.
Strive for color diversity in your meals, as it often reflects a range of nutrients.

Use smaller plates to avoid overeating.

Reduce consumption of foods high in sugar, sodium, and unhealthy fats (like trans fats).
Opt for whole, unprocessed foods whenever possible.
5. Prioritize Fiber
Include fiber-rich foods such as whole grains, beans, lentils, fruits, and vegetables.

Include healthy snacks to avoid overeating during main meals.

Check for hidden sugars, unhealthy fats, and sodium content in packaged foods.

Seek advice from a dietitian or nutritionist for personalized guidance.
Monitor and adapt your diet if you have specific health conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure.
